## Challenges:

I felt very confident with the css and jquery when I started. I felt amazed by how much code I could just write without looking anything up. But then I struggled understanding how to move from jquery to javascript. I understand one is a library, but you can't call things normally because of the document ready function and scope. I moved into javascript and stayed there. Then I struggled with scope even more. This is why I never got an attack method to work. I don't understand how to call on teh enemy class from within the character class if I have changing enemies and can't use variable name. This was where I got stuck for days and didn't get much help. I ran out of time and hurried to end the game. 
IDEALLY:
I want to have some levels with prompts where the user makes good or bad decisions. Then I wanted atleast 3 fight levels. An enemy arrives and depending on what atttack you use, determines the fate. I wanted to give the option to heal at times and proceed with different amounts of items and abilities. I wanted to have one single fight modal that I could just populate the DOM using jquery with the information based on the level.
I really wanted my images to show up.
